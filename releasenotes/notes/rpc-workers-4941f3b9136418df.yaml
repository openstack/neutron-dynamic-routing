    The BGP service plugin RPC queue has been added to RPC workers, like
    it is done in other Neutron service plugins (l3-plugin, metering, etc.).
    This fixes RPC requests and AMQP heartbeats not getting processed in
    time, causing AMQP connection dropping, and other unpredictable unwanted
    behavior.
    See bug `1974057 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1974057>`_.
