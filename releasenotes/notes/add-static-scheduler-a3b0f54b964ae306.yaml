    A new BGP scheduler has been added, called ``StaticScheduler``. It will
    not perform any automatic scheduling of speakers to agents, instead
    relying on API calls to perform explicit scheduling, fulfilling the
    needs of larger deployments.
    See also bug `1920065 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1920065>`_.
    The plan is to make the ``StaticScheduler`` the default option for the next
    release and possibly deprecate the current default, ``ChanceScheduler``.
